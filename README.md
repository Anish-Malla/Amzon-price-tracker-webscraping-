In this video we made a simple web scraping tool using Beautiful soup and Python. We regularly check the price of an item and when the price does go down we send an email to the user alerting them that the price has decreased.

This is a great beginning project for someone who is interested by the concept of web scraping and the endless amount of project you could do with it.
